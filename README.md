Formz is a React form library based on hooks, designed from the ground up to be as efficient, robust
and easy to understand as possible. With a size of **4kb gzipped**, it packs in a full form state
management engine, including validations, values parsing & formatting and much more.

## Installation

That one is easy. Like must libraries, just use `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
$ npm i formz --save
``` 

```bash
$ yarn add formz
```

## Requirements

To keep `formz` size to the minimum, it has **zero** dependencies and only a peer dependency
with `react >= 17`.
