## Overview

Formz was created in 2018 by Ron Dadon while working at Samanage (acquired by SolarWinds in 2019)
in order to solve the problem of form state handling in React. Until that point, `redux-form` was
the de-facto form library, especially when `redux` was already in use by the application.

Coming over to React from AngularJS (R.I.P), I felt a bit overwhalmed by the amount of code required
to make forms work, and later as I got to know and understand `redux` better, I've found myself
wondering why should I update a global state store everytime a temporary internal form state is
updated.

Searching the web at that time, did not lead me to any library I really liked, so Formz was born.

It is in use by the Service Desk application since than, in production, with 1000's of active users
using forms it handles on a daily basis.

React has changed a lot since 2018, and the library was completely written in the beginning of 2022
to be a pure hooks based library, and moving state to context instead of internal class state.
At that time, the library was also split under the `@formz` namespace, with `@formz/core` containing
all the core functionality, and other utilities / framework integrations will be released under the
`@formz` namespace as separate libraries.

## License

The library is released under the MIT license.
