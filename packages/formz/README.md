# Formz

You can find the full documentation at [https://ron-dadon.github.io/formz](https://ron-dadon.github.io/formz) or visit the [github repository](https://github.com/ron-dadon/formz).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i formz --save
``` 

```bash
$ yarn add formz
```

## Requirements

To keep `formz` size to the minimum, it is not compiled with `react` and `prop-types`, but uses them as a peer dependency, so you must have `react` and `prop-types` as a dependency in your project.
