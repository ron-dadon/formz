<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT</strong> - <code>validate</code> function changes are triggering an update to
  the form state,
  since every field <code>validate</code> function is stored in the state in order for it to run
  before the form
  is submitted. You must memoized this function using <code>useCallback</code> or any other memoize
  method so
  it will not trigger a state update if not really changed.

# Components

## Form

The `Form` component renders a `FormzContext.Provider` component and passes the entire form state
to it, so it is available to the `Form` children using the `useFormzContext` or `useField` hooks.

The `children` are wrapped with a `form` tag, and you can provide additional props to it via
`formProps` prop on the `Form`.

The `Form` component supports the following props:

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                             | Default | Required |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `onSubmit`        | A callback function that will be called when the form is submitted. The function will get an object with `{ values, event, options, validationErrors }` | -       | ‚úì        |
| `formProps`       | Props that should be passed on to the `form` tag that is wrapping the `children`. All valid `form` tag props are supported                              | -       | êÑÇ       |
| `onSubmitSuccess` | A callback function that will be called with the result of `onSubmit` in case of successful submission                                                  | -       | êÑÇ       |
| `onSubmitError`   | A callback function that will be called with the error of `onSubmit` in case of failed submission                                                       | -       | êÑÇ       |
