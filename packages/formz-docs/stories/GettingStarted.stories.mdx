## Overview

Formz was created in 2018 by [Ron Dadon](https://github.com/ron-dadon) while working at [Samanage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samanage) (acquired by SolarWinds in 2019)
in order to solve the problem of form state handling in React. Until that point, `redux-form` was
the de-facto form library, especially when `redux` was already in use by the application.

Coming over to React from AngularJS (R.I.P), I felt a bit overwhalmed by the amount of code required
to make forms work, and later as I got to know and understand `redux` better, I've found myself
wondering why should I update a global state store everytime a temporary internal form state is
updated.

Searching the web at that time, did not lead me to any library I really liked, so Formz was born.

It is in use by the [Service Desk](https://www.solarwinds.com/service-desk) application since than, in production, with 1000's of active users
using forms it handles on a daily basis.

React has changed a lot since 2018, and the library was completely written in the beginning of 2022
to be a pure hooks based library, and moving state to context instead of internal class state.
At that time, the library was also split, with `formz` containing
all the core functionality, and other utilities / framework integrations will be released under the
`formz-*` as separate libraries.

## Install

`npm install formz` OR `yarn add formz`

## License

The library is released under the MIT license.

## Previous versions

Version 2 is a complete re-write and it is **not** backward compatible at all. Some features were
dropped during the rewrite after learning that they are rarely to never used.

<div class="alert alert-warning">The first version of the library is considered deprecated at this point. Only critical bug fixes will be applied to it if needed.</div>
